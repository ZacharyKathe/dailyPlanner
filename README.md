### This was a fun Bootstrap, jQuery and JavaScript exercise!

### I had to utilize my knowledge of DOM traversal to get the input to save properly in local storage. 
### I used momment.js to set the time at the top of the screen. The boxes are suppose to change colors once the time has past that particular hour but my finction was not working properly.
